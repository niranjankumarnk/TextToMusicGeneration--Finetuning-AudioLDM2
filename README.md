# TextToMusicGeneration--Finetuning-AudioLDM2


## !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Still the model is not finetuned properly, there has some noise, currently working on that**

This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning the AudioLDM2 model for music generation using text prompts. The project focuses on developing deep learning models for audio processing, optimizing model parameters, and generating high-quality music compositions from textual input.
