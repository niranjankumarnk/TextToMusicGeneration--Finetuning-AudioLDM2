# TextToMusicGeneration--Finetuning-AudioLDM2

**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  
_The model is still under fine-tuning. There is currently some noise in the generated music, and I am actively working on improving the output quality._

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning the **AudioLDM2** model for music generation using **text prompts**. The aim of this project is to develop deep learning models capable of generating high-quality music compositions from textual inputs, optimizing the parameters of the AudioLDM2 architecture to enhance audio fidelity and reduce noise.

## Current Status
- The model is in the fine-tuning phase.
- There are issues with **noise** in the generated music outputs.
- Ongoing work is focused on **reducing noise** and **improving sound quality** for cleaner music generation.

## Objectives
- Fine-tune the AudioLDM2 model to improve the accuracy and quality of text-to-music generation.
- Explore advanced deep learning techniques for **audio signal processing** and **acoustic scene classification**.
- Generate high-fidelity music from textual prompts with potential applications in **AI-driven music production** and **sound design**.

## Features
- Text-based music generation.
- Fine-tuned deep learning models for **audio processing**.
- Optimized model parameters to improve **audio quality** and reduce noise.
