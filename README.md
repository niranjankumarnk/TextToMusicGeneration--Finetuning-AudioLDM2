# TextToMusicGeneration--Finetuning-AudioLDM2

**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  
_The model has been fine-tuned, but there is still some noise in the generated music. Work is ongoing to improve output quality._

## Audio Samples

Here are some examples of the music generated by the fine-tuned AudioLDM2 model.

## Current Status
- Fine-tuning completed with initial results.
- Noise persists in generated music outputs.
- Ongoing efforts to further reduce noise and enhance sound quality.
- Exploring a custom model architecture to address these issues and improve audio clarity

## Objectives
- Fine-tune the AudioLDM2 model to improve the accuracy and quality of text-to-music generation.
- Explore advanced deep learning techniques for **audio signal processing** and **acoustic scene classification**.
- Generate high-fidelity music from textual prompts with potential applications in **AI-driven music production** and **sound design**.

## Features
- Text-based music generation.
- Fine-tuned deep learning models for **audio processing**.
- Optimized model parameters to improve **audio quality** and reduce noise.
